MIMO岻梧


　　U-E, when your channel looks fine,

　　I said, U-E, give the network a sign,

　　Which means, U-E,give a high C-Q-I,

　　To report what you have measured.

　　U-E, there is data for you,

　　And two codewords,

　　I think they may come through,

　　So let¨s put them onto different ports

　　And use spatial multiplexing.

　　In other words it is M-I-M-O.

　　In other words it is M-I-M-O.

　　You don¨t need M-L-D,

　　There are plenty of ways,

　　Manufacturers have a choice ...

　　M-I-M-O.

　　In other words it is M-I-M-O.

　　Two antennas you need,

　　Four by four is agreed,

　　And your throughput can be so high!

　　U-E, can you see the Node-B?

　　Come on, U-E,should it do T-x-D?

　　Alamouti is a simple approach.

　　But you¨ve got to know this one thing!

　　Node-B is not serving just you.

　　I said, Node-B,has a whole cell to do,

　　And at cell-edge there¨s no M-I-M-O

　　¨Cause the S-I-N-R is low.

　　You cannot always do M-I-M-O.

　　You cannot always do M-I-M-O.

　　Two R-x ports you have

　　So you still can combine,

　　And the coverage should be fine ...

　　M-I-M-O.

　　It¨s good for you to use M-I-M-O.

　　Two antennas you need,

　　Four by four is agreed,

　　And your throughput can be so high!

　　U-E, if you want to transmit,

　　I say, U-E, MI-MO isn¨t legit,

　　You will have towait for L-T-E- A,

　　Where RAN-1 will make it okay.

　　That¨s where the decisions are made,

　　And where many MI-MO sessions run late,

　　So that Dirk says: ｀Juho will you take care

　　Of this bunch of loopy people?¨.

　　It¨s fun to standardize M-I-M-O.

　　It¨s fun to specify M-I-M-O.

　　You don¨t need M-L-D

　　There are plenty of ways,

　　Manufacturers have a choice ...

　　M-I-M-O.

　　It¨s fun to specify M-I-M-O.

　　When your channel looks fine,

　　Give the network a sign.

　　M-I-M-O.

　　Then just go and do M-I-M-O.

　　Can you see the Node-B?

　　Should it do T-x-D?
